APPLICATION DESCRIPTION

Our API serves two primary purposes: 
-Public Search Functionality:
Users can search for nearby fuel stations based on filters such as fuel type, services, and address.

-User Account Features:

Users can create accounts or log in to save their favorite stations, eliminating the need to repeat search filters.
By logging in, users can create lists like "Work Commute" and add nearby stations to the list. 
If the user changes their workplace, they can easily modify their lists by removing existing stations and adding new ones. 
This personalized experience enhances user convenience.
